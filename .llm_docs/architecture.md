# Emerge Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Emerge is a Python-based interactive code analysis tool that provides insights about source code structure, metrics, dependencies and complexity of software projects. It supports multiple programming languages and generates interactive visualizations of code structure.

## Core Components

The architecture consists of several key components:

1. Language Parsers
2. Metrics System  
3. Analysis Engine
4. Export System
5. Web UI Generation

Let's examine each component in detail:

### 1. Language Parsers

The language parsing system is responsible for:
- Reading source code files
- Parsing code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
- Extracting structural information like classes, functions, and dependencies
- Supporting multiple programming languages through modular parser plugins

### 2. Metrics System

The metrics system calculates various code quality and complexity metrics:
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Lines of code
- Dependencies between components
- Code duplication
- Test coverage integration
- Custom metric definitions

### 3. Analysis Engine

The analysis engine processes the parsed code and metrics to:
- Build dependency graphs
- Identify code patterns and anti-patterns
- Generate structural representations
- Calculate aggregate metrics
- Perform trend analysis

### 4. Export System

The export system handles:
- JSON/XML data export
- Report generation
- Integration with external tools
- Custom export format plugins
- Data persistence

### 5. Web UI Generation

The web interface provides:
- Interactive visualizations
- Dependency graphs
- Metric dashboards
- Code structure navigation
- Search and filtering
- Custom view configurations

## System Interactions

The components interact in the following way:

1. Language parsers process source code into ASTs
2. Analysis engine uses ASTs to build dependency graphs
3. Metrics system analyzes the graphs and code structure
4. Export system saves analysis results
5. Web UI reads exported data to generate visualizations

## Extension Points

The architecture supports extensibility through:
- Custom language parser plugins
- Metric definition plugins
- Export format plugins
- Visualization plugins
- Analysis rule plugins

## Technology Stack

- Python core implementation
- Tree-sitter for parsing
- NetworkX for graph processing
- D3.js for visualizations
- Flask/FastAPI for web interface
- SQLite/PostgreSQL for data storage

## Future Considerations

- Real-time analysis capabilities
- IDE integration
- Cloud deployment support
- Machine learning integration
- Performance optimization for large codebases

## Security Considerations

- Secure handling of source code
- Access control for web interface
- Data encryption at rest
- API authentication
- Audit logging

## Development Guidelines

- Modular component design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation requirements
- Code style consistency

This architecture provides a foundation for building a scalable and extensible code analysis tool while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
