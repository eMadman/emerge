SmartSpin2k - A buildable software & hardware project that can upgrade a stationary spin bike into a smart bike. 

This software registers an ESP32 as a BLE FTMS device which then uses a stepper motor to turn the resistance knob on a regular spin bike.
BLE code based on examples from https://github.com/nkolban
